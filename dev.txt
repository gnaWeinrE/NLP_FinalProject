He / she can just press the button or send e - mail to operate what he / she needs , even though the owner is far from the house .

On the other hand , people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a " family " .

In spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer , but by parents themselves .

Why people like so much go shopping ?
Why do people like to go shopping so much ?
In my opinion the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind of things for her family , so for them , shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drive them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money .
In my opinion the majority of people who go shopping are women who must buy food and other kinds of things for their families , so , for them , shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated every day and that drives them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money .
Othrewise , there are people who think the opposite ; such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they go to buy hardly ever , only when they need clothes or something for their job or school .
On the other hand , there are people who think the opposite , such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they hardly ever go shopping - only when they need clothes , or something for their job or school .
In that way shopping can be as funny as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation in the future .
In that way shopping can be as much fun as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation in the future .
To sum up , all you make in small cuantities is good and funny , but do n't encrease them if you do n't want to feel uncomfortable .

Public transportation has been used by people more and over the years it has been kind of becoming cheaper and also safer , but some people prefer cars . To what extent do we agree with this and what are our reasons for that ? That is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay .
before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end
About 40 years ago , there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those years there were not even good facilities to move from one place to another and that is because there were no companies to build cars . After about 10 years , car trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans . At the beginning , they faced a lot of problems , but they were able to solve them in the end .
nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places
Nowadays all modes of transport are more convenient , from cars to buses , even trains and planes . Some people prefer cars because they do not like crowded places or because they find it cheaper sometimes , but from another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster . But when it comes to traveling , a lot of people prefer driving their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy themselves more by avoiding crowded places .
to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used

At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending .

He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .

Nevertheless , the narrator is the truly protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .

Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .

And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .

Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters said .

The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .

He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient power .

However , his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .

Beside this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .

Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .

In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief that talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .

This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk with short and simple sentences .
This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk in short and simple sentences .
For instance , here is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :

" My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up " by hand . "

Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand . "

On the other hand , the dialogues are simple and shorter :

" Now lookee here , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know

what a file is ? "

" Yes , sir . "

" And you know what wittles is ? "

" Yes , sir . "

Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .

Pip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .

Regardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .

The thief said " Who d'ye with ? "

Notwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist .

The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without flashback .

The story is narrated as it happens .

The second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .

Also , the slow rhythm is adequate .

The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .

The thief disappears , but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting .
The thief disappears , but the first chapter 's ending makes us feel curious about their next meeting .
Therefore , I do not know how the story will end .

Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters .

All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .

Probably , the thief will take Pip to an unwanted adventure that will make him growing up faster .

From one point of view , top athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons .

Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .

This means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .

Secondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .

The importance of working hard to achieve goalы and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .

From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good role models .
From another perspective , sometimes , professional athletes are not good role models .
Firstly , sport has become business .

Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame .

This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .

Secondly , there are those athletes who behave disgustingly .

For example , some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost .

It goes without saying , that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young .

I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one . I am referring to Lugo city .
I visited Lugo last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .

I walked through the old city , through its beautiful squares and parks and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedral .

There are a lot of places in Lugo worth visiting .

For example , you can walk around the Roman Wall , which has been declared a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 because it is the only Roman Wall in the world that is complete .

I think that Lugo is very beautiful .

There are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .

In Lugo , many traditional parties and festivals take place .

Among the most important I can mention San Froilán and Arde Lucus .

From 4th to 12th October Lugo holds its San Froilán Fiestas .

San Froilán is a festival of National Tourist Interest .

This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician costumes and folklore .

Another important festival in Lugo is Arde Lucus .

It is celebrated in June .

During this festivity , Lugo becomes the 3rd century town once again , so you can see Roman circus , Celtic weddings , artisan markets , many musical events taking place and local people and visitors get into period costumes , such as gladiators and Roman Emperors .

It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .

For example , you can travel to new places .

Another idea is you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .

Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .

You can travel to different countries if you have time , I would like to go to Asia , Thailand or China .

However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .

Since you ' ve applied for the sales position assistant in the sales department , the sales manager will be interviewing you .
He started out his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with numbers all day long .

Plus , he 's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to the sales department two years ago .

He got promoted very quickly because he always brought forth new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department .

In his eyes , what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous working experiences , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job .

I hope what I mention above will be of some help to you .

Looking forward to hearing from you soon .

Dear Sir or Madam

I write in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer camps all over the USA .

Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .

Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hunts and paper chases .

Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .

I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance .

Yet , oftentimes , being overly respectful may play against him and although he has gained the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his self - confidence , rather than end up attempting to cover everyone 's back and taking ownership for other people 's mistakes .

For example , one year ago , I had my final surgery exam .

Moreover , if I aim at getting high scores , I assert that memorizing the details is important .

Subject : An important thing to do !

My dear Paul ,

I ' m writing to tell you how happy I am that I had the opportunity to be the chosen person to deal with the sound recording at Lady Gaga 's concert .

It must have been my friend , Marius Boni , who recommended me for this service .

I could n't believe my ears when the phone rang and I answered and they said they wanted me to get at the concert as soon as possible to see how good I was in sound recording .

Every day , as soon as I woke up , I looked forward to my morning on the slopes .
My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .

The temperature was often several degrees below zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .

My brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .

Little by little I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself .

Hi John !

It 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you some details about my experience at " Zoe Kak adventure " , one of the most well - known centres in our country .

First of all , we started with a tiring assault course , which consisted of climbing up pretty sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles .

Although it made me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertaining .

Luckily , I was fit enough to finish the exercise without having any problem , however , you may need to train a little bit more before embarking on this activity .

Rock climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .

Despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to reach the summit .

You ca n't imagine how rewarding is the feeling of being on the top of the mountain , after such a big effort ! .

She told me that when I was on holidays I had to buy myself a plane ticket to Paris and go to visit her for at least two months because she was missing me a lot .

It felt so good when I saw that my mother had n't forgotten me .

Catch it or lose it

The alpha and the omega of a good team is trust .

That 's the most important point if you want to play handball .

You must be able to throw the ball blindly to your teammate and he has to catch it .

Otherwise the opponent will have the chance to get a point .

Are you a real team player ?

Handball is one of the most dynamic sports in this world .

Over eighty points can be made all together in sixty minutes , if not even more .

This shows how rapidly the game can change .

One lost ball can make your team the loser of the game .

I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .

At first , it was only a hobby but with the years it became passion .

Does traveling broaden your mind ?

In my opinion , travelling does broaden your mind .

When visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
When you visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .

For example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .

Travelling also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .

This can help you to understand that not everyone has acces to many things you do have acces too , and to realise that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even fresh water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is not true .

And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?

The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had fallen asleep on the couch watching TV .

I got up and I made my way to the front door .

Outside stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter .

I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriends .

She came down , but she did not scream .

Instead she started crying .

The man as it turned out was my father , who had been missing for 15 years ...

I did not know that he was still alive .

Mother had always told me he had died in the war .

I think she did this for my own good .

I was very bemused by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .

In my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something exotic .

It was very odd to see him in my home .

Now we all live together .

Although the first days were difficult , now we all get on well .

It is great to be a whole family again .

The Grand Place is the central square of Brussels .

It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages .

These were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .

They helped each other and the elders ones taught the youngsters .

Introduction .

The aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your centre after one year running .

This report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .

The gym .

The machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer .

On the other hand , the gym is too small .

Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
Every afternoon it is crowded , so it is very difficult to do exercise .
The swimming pool .

It is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length , about 20 metres .

Furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .

On the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .

Conclusions .

The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger .

Furthermore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .

The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries .

According to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.

These ones are called " source countries " , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .

Otherwise , the countries with the highest saliaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are called " destination countries " because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .

Moreover , in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earns , apart from the last country , Country D. In this one , the salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .

In many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces .

Although such a show of strength by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .

However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be categorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
Rather , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other .

In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .

Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .

Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .

How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide ' ?

Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurence is for some good .

Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy .

In Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thunder - der - Troncks .

The whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme .

For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .

Candide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sceptical of it .

This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the province .

Candide can not see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .

The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters .

Candide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .

He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - da - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves- the list continues .

It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity .

However it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .

When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .

They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force .
They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly - formed national government to operate as a single international political force .
A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .

It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states , but no - one would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making body .

In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force .

Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament , something which no state in the United States could lawfully do .

We are still a very long way from a Single Parliament for Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .

Of course , the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe .

Of course Britain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union .

It has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .

To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .

With 1992 now only a year away , the question of what a Single Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant .

I firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .

This loss need not however be negative .

Now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : Will this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation ?

Firstly , a positive approach .

Looking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .

The benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .

Firms , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .

Europe will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition .

To look at things on a more individual level , every member of the new Single Europe 's standard of living should increase .

A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , result in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .

Simplicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .

If this is so , they should also work better .

Ideally then , there should be more equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .

On the other hand , will this Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?

It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .

Why should this matter ?

Well , Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions .

It is possible that it could become engulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its identity .

Britons ( especially those from older generations ) may then feel " lost " and that they do not really " belong " any more .

The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .

Then there is the question as to whether all this idealism really will work .

Will there be greater prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies ?

Britain , although small , is more often than not in the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
Britain , although small , is more often than not at the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
Has it then not got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this Single Europe ?

No one would dispute that this is a difficult question .

The fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .

This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful the Single Europe will be .

It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerancy .

The European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .

The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .

In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers ; movement not only of goods but of services , capital and people .

However , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?

Let us look at the founding of the European Community , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail .

There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War , but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent .

The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .

This fresh start came about because of three main factors .

Firstly , was Europe 's realization of her own weakness , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .

One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958 .

Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .

One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law .

This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called " integration " .

The 1970 's saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .

All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .

This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimous voting , not majority voting .

Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firm .

Last year , the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .

Many youths in low income areas see boxing as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the way .

There are , however , people who regard boxing as barbaric , brutal and primitive .

These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .

During the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .

All precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .

During fights doctors a kept close to the ring and have the authority to call it off prematurely if required .

Because there are so many budding young boxers , to ban boxing would be insane , since it would almost certainly go underground .

Underground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .

Taking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .

The sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form , he says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of his fights have been won on points .

There is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .

This is emphasised and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport tragically dies .

Let us consider how a professional boxer would feel .

He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoys it so much .

I have yet to hear any boxer regret his choice of career .

The excitement of being in the ring , the joy at knocking an opponent onto the canvass , and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting .

There were 2 main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery .

The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more than another form of taxation , in fact , none than that , a tax on the poor .
The second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .

There was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which was not seen as the strongest contender for the bid : other companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs .

Richard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity , but was rejected .

My personal objections to Camelot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the consortium are american or foreign firms , for example IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot .

In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retained , but not in its present form . I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give forteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .

The computer has been one of the most influential inventions of all time .

Computers now dominate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .

In many ways , it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .

The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numerical calculations .

This has made it no longer necessary for humans to perform calculations and run through equations , and so they need not understand the principles behind them any longer .
This , unfortunately , means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator , who needs only to know which buttons to press .

This may seem an extreme view , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case centuries into the future .

Computers have been used as a means of keeping records , they have all but superseded handwritten text , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the globe , even to create artwork and to entertain .

Computer generated pictures , including ' fractal ' pictures , drawn from equations , seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real , physical world .

Virtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created for them by a computer .

Whether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body all but redundant .

People , businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the globe by fax machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer these forms of communication to actually meeting face to face .

Money can be transferred instantly without even needing to move the actual money - the physical coinage does n't matter , it is the computer records that state how much each bank has ownership of .

However , the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity for coping with anything outside their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgement .
However , the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true ! Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity for coping with anything outside their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgement .
Human beings often act without logic or reason , and only other human beings can cope and deal with that .

Also , computers can break down , and then a human is needed to take control - such as an airline pilot , and there are still certain tasks only a human being can perform , and they are often among the simplest .

The fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything above the mud hut ' existence .

no - one created genetic manipulation , the power of it was there to be discovered .

If one scientist does not make a discovery then another one will .

It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist at the forefront of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independently afterwards .
The only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .

While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .

But , once genetic manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the originals scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for other 's misuse of it .

The so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .

Herds where this disease was found were put down before the symptoms progressed further .

Those cows which had been put down were not used for food .

The disease infects the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain , and as the spinal fluid is usually spilt in the slaughter of cattle for meat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .

The human disease , Crentzfeld - Jacob disease , or CJD , is believed to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two .

It is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the rise , or whether awareness of the condition is heightened , but more cases , from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the disease is always fatal .

However , people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K. , and many are abstaining from eating beef .

Even if the entire beef industry were to grind to a halt , the numerous heads of beef cattle worldwide would no longer be needed , but , being bred as they are , for beef , they would be useless for milk products .

Not all beef can be infected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game .

For beef to be repreived or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .

The nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests that there be no proven link .

Watch this space .

Personally , I believe that it is merely that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before .

Some reports say that it can take up to 20 years to develop , so we could all already have it .

The question of compensation for services rendered is never so simple as remitting a predetermined salary based on qualifications and a person 's dedication to the task at hand .

The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women .

Some women were happy with old traditions , some wanted a bit more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .

What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules .

This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked down upon by their piers .

An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war .

Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on .

They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight .

I felt that these people were crazy .

Women just ca n't fight in a war very well .

I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true , but now many employers are the victims .

They are scared of what a woman can do and sometimes women get looked at differently .

There are some things that women can do better than men and there are some things that men can do better than women .

God would have created us all the same if this was not true .

Feminists are trying to make everyone equal and that is impossible to do because nature can not be changed .

More and more office jobs are being filled by the woman but a lot of the physical jobs are still filled by men .

Whenever a movement is began whether it be political , religious , or artistic , stereotypes are quick to form .
Whenever a movement is begun , whether it be political , religious , or artistic , stereotypes are quick to form .
People normally associated with politics , religion , or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences .

This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary .

This is especially true of the Women 's Liberation Movement in America .

Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century , Women 's Liberation has been met with adamant , and often obstinate oppostion .

Some of the first radicals , Susan B. Anthony and George Sand ( although French ) were noticed and ridiculed , thus defeating their cause , because of their aggressive action .

At the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement .

However , I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception of those observing the movement .

When Women 's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s , it was again destined for failure .

Immediately , the focus was on radicals like Stein , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself .

Those outside the movement could only see the differences between " normality " and Women 's Lib .

This is still true twenty - five years later .

Women supporting equal pay for women and and other " liberal " causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra - burning , anti - shaving leaders of the 1970s .

The good of their cause is undermined by the perception of the radicals .

So what am I getting at ?

Only that so - called feminists have not in and of themselves harmed the Women 's movement .

However , the popular perception of them has .

For so many years the good that feminists have promote for women has fallen by the wayside in lieu of other more interesting , i.e. radical ideas .

Clearly , of the inventions of this century , the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television .

This instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible .

However , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to tune out reality .

Television has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at current events than can not be given by newspaper .

Television has the power to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully .

However , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .

On the contrary , television has become the escape route of the masses , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront them and try to understand them .

In the minds of most Americans , television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge .

Millions of Americans can be found to be staring at the T.V. at any one time , watching sit - coms , soap - operas , and cartoons .

Television , therefore , has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .

It has given society another creative vein , a look at worlds which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .

However , throughout the years , television has lost much of its integrety ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .

The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medical chemistry .
As a natural antibiotic , penicillin was discovered to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infections .

This " wonder - drug " also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - occurring antibiotics that could also be cultured " in vitro " in a laboratory .

It was also attempted to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
Both of these new attempts caused a need for more research , more companies , and more medical chemists , and the industry increased tremendously .

It was discovered that the older drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active .

New drugs were also synthesized ; some were found to be medically useful while others were not .

A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine .

It was now much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple illnesses , such as the common cold .

Huge enterprises , such as Upjohn , were formed and grew , and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient synthesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics .

The discovery of one compound led to the increase of health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a booming industry comprised of research teams and large companies .

The synthesis of antibiotics and research of their uses still continues today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .

The mental effect of computers is two - fold .

Firstly , computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works .

This has created a surplus of " needless " computations , figures , etc .

What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time .

Mathematical models , theories , etc .

are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't predict .

Due to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Due to this , errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant - for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people .

A computer 's circuits do n't get tired and , if programmed 100 % correctly ( another perhaps impossible computation ) , never make errors .

This supposed reliability has left many workers out of work .

The effects of this are unpredictable .

Anger , frustration , fear , and many other negative feelings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer usage .

Clearly , there is evidence of good and bad results from the advent of the modern computer .

It would be practically impossible to throw the computer away or never use it again .

Yet there are practical solutions .

Better mathematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer other than a simple calculator .

Also , curtailing some theoretical programming could eliminate alarming predictions or erroneous results .

The key is probably in the classroom .

As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have the woman in the home , housekeeping and tending the children .

The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Equal Rights Amendment , which failed .

Even today , the woman is still only earning something like 60 cents for every dollar that a man earns .

Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .

It 's only recently that we ' ve " discovered " , or begun to think about rather , how much things as varying as pornography or the language we use helps to form the image of women .
It 's only recently that we ' ve " discovered " , or begun to think about rather , many much things varied varying as pornography or the language we help helps to form the image of women .
A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down , so that women are seen for who they truly are .

Feminism is better described as a " discovery in progress " ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not yet become mainstream .

Only when women have achieved equality with men , will there cease to be a need for feminism , and the discovery will have been completed .

According to l'Academie Française , all literature of the Neoclassical period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violence , church , and state issues .
Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time , setting and plot true to life .

Voltaire , as a Neoclassicist , knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature .

However , when writing Candide , Voltaire defied the Academie 's rules .

Candide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism .

Ironically , although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence , each act is treated lightly : Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating ; and after Candide " kills " the Baron , he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels .

Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen .

The differences they are rediscovering only add more color , flavor and excitement to that brewing " pot " of our people .

However , some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion ( seen most clearly through the arts ) .

They do n't want to accept these differences .

They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans .

As Ellie Weisel , author of such books as Night says about indifference : it is the opposite of everything good .

The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , light , joy , life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference .

Violence on television can be seen throughout the many channels that cable has to offer .

With an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily , the prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern .
